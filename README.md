## Introduction

Snake Game using Tkinter is a classic arcade-style game developed in Python. The game allows players to control a snake, navigate it around the game board, eat food items, and grow longer. The objective is to achieve the highest score without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive gameplay.
- Colorful graphics using Tkinter.
- Real-time scoring system.
- Direction control with arrow keys.
- Collision detection for game over.

## How to Play

1. Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the snake's movement.
2. Eat the food items (displayed as colored dots) to grow the snake and increase the score.
3. Avoid collisions with the walls or the snake's own body.
4. The game ends when the snake collides, and a "GAME OVER" message is displayed.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python (https://www.python.org/) installed.
3. Run the Snake_Game.py script to start the game.
